Voltage references are crucial to biasing analog and digital circuits.  In this paper, four different voltage reference designs were analyzed and iterated for optimization in terms of the temperature coefficient, $V_{_{DD}}$ sensitivity, and the total power consumption.  The approach was to develop equations and calculate each design parameter and then simulate and verify the handwritten calculations to LTspice.  Based on the results, the circuit was either modified for improved performance or stored as the final result.  Overall, the methodology and approach led to the design goals being mostly met.
